A widget/plugin that uses the Louder.org.uk Developer's API to access a list of campaigns and display them.

== Description ==

The Louder Campaignlist plugin will display a set limit of campaigns (including optional campaign logo) with links to the relevant Louder campaign page, drawn from the selected Louder directory category. So you can display links to campaigns of specific interest to you and your readers in, for example, a column in the sidebar of your blog.
